Hyper Intelligent AI Doctor

README Hyper Intelligent AI Doctor The Hyper Intelligent AI Doctor is an AI-powered chatbot that diagnoses illnesses and provides treatment solutions. The chatbot uses the OpenAI and Weaviate technologies to respond to user queries. The program is written in Python, and it utilizes several different libraries. Some of these include, ElementTree (ET) as a parser for XML files, the requests library for HTTP request calls to PubMed, the nplib module for article documentation, the weaviate library for creating, querying and deleting objects in Weaviate, and the duckduckgo search engine. Additionally, the chatbot uses the OpenAI machine learning API, which is responsible for natural language processing and conversation creation.
